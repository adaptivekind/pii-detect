## Project Evolution Summary

This project was built incrementally through these key phases:

1. **Initial Implementation**: Created a Python CLI using Microsoft Presidio for PII detection
2. **Documentation**: Added project documentation and developer guidance
3. **Code Organization**: Restructured code into proper directory structure and modular components
4. **Testing**: Implemented comprehensive unit and integration tests
5. **CI/CD**: Added GitHub Actions for automated testing, linting, and security scanning
6. **Documentation**: Created this bootstrap history for project reference

Each prompt built upon the previous work, resulting in a well-structured, tested, and professionally maintained open-source project.
